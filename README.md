A collection of browser based tools that do image related things. 
Sometimes related to my personal practice of generating algorithmic artworks using code. 
Sometimes with a more generic usecase that can be used with any image (photography, personal pictures, etc). 

See [https://josvromans.github.io/imagetools/](https://josvromans.github.io/imagetools/) for a list of the tools and what they do.

All tools have the following in common:

- They work in the web browser, also offline
- No data will be sent to a server.
- Any image you load on any of these pages will stay in your own browser only.
- Any operation done with the image happens by JavaScript code in your browser.
- The code is open source, you can copy any part you want, or fork the repository.
- There are no dependencies, every app is a single html page + javascript + css.
- No cookies, no adds, no externatal assets.

A lot of tools are on the list to publish here in the future, for example image kernels and filters.
So hopefully this will grow into a list of more useful things.
